### Leet code

I like in LeetCode its respectful set of programming exercises. 
Everything is OK, until you try to understand what they want from your life. 
The Biggest issues are not clear description. The level of the problem is opinionated.

Next, when you try to find explanation on youtube rarely you have getting good blogger.
It is a crap.
